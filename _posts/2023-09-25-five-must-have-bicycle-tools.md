A stitch in time saves nine and bike niggles are easily fixed at home. A small set of core tools goes a long way in adjusting and fixing these niggles. This set of core tools doesn't cost much and takes only a bit of storage space. Yet, they save you time, money and trips to the bicycle shop to fix mundane problems. So here is a set of 5 essential tools every bicycle enthusiast should have-

## 1. Floor pump with gauge
A floor pump with a gauge is crucial for maintaining the correct tire pressure. Always check the air pressure before heading out on a ride. It doesn't matter which tyres you ride - cheap or expensive. The correct tyre pressure will make your ride more comfortable, save watts and extend the tyre life too. A floor pump also makes fixing punctures much easier and faster. Look for one with a dedicated nozzle for both Schrader and Presta valves. A popular floor pump like the [Decathlon Cycling Floor Pump 500](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8303706/cycle-pumps/cycling-floor-pump-500?id=8303706&type=p) requires you to take apart the nozzle to fit Presta or Schrader valves. This gets tiring very quickly. If you're low on budget a frame pump will serve, but it is much easier and faster to use a floor pump for everyday use.

### My Pick
- Budget - [Icetoolz Sport Steel Floor Pump](https://gearlama.com/search?q=IceToolz+Sport+Steel+Floor+Pump)
- Premium - [Lezyne Macro Floor Drive Digital](https://www.worldofwheelz.in/product/lezyne-micro-floor-drive-hvhigh-volume-pump?utm_source=gearlama&utm_medium=website&utm_id=gearlama.com&wow_utm_id=AFFL1732102702)

## 2. Tyre levers
Wide plastic tyre levers are essential for removing wired tires without damaging the rims or pinching the tube. They save your hands and are a must-have for any cyclist. While plastic tyre levers they might bend, they don't break off easily.

### My Pick  
- Budget - [Decathlon Yellow Tyre Levers](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8047839/cycle-inner-tubes/pack-of-3-tyre-levers-yellow?id=8047839&type=p)
- Premium - [Clever Standard Lever](https://gearlama.com/search?q=clever+tyre)

## 3. Allen key set
Modern bicycles often use Allen/Torx bolts, so a Y wrench with 4, 5, and 6 mm bits is recommended. These sizes cover the most common bolts, and a Y tool makes switching between them easy.

- Budget - [Icetoolz Y Hex Key Wrench](https://gearlama.com/search?q=y+Icetoolz+hex)
- Premium - [Pedros Y hex wrench](https://gearlama.com/search?q=pedros+Y+hex+wrench)

## 4. Drivetrain cleaning tool
Cleaning your drivetrain is essential for bike maintenance. A chain cleaning tool simplifies this process, saves time, and prevents messy degreaser stains. Look for one with replaceable innards to save money in the long run.

### My Pick
- Premium - [Pedros Chain Pig](https://gearlama.com/search?q=pedros+chain+pig)
- Premium - [ParkTool Cyclone Chain Scrubber](https://gearlama.com/search?q=cyclone+parktool) 

## 5. Bike Stand
A simple bike stand that lifts the rear wheel off the ground is incredibly useful for inspecting and maintaining the drivetrain, brakes, and wheels. A portable "A" shaped stand is a good option for apartment dwellers. It also takes the least amount of space when packed away. If your bike doesn't have a kickstand you can always use the repair stand as a parking stand.

### My Pick
- Budget - [NAC Ergo Multipurpose Stand](https://gearlama.com/search?q=NAC+Ergo+Multipurpose+Stand)
- Premium - [Pedros Folding Repair Stand](https://gearlama.com/search?q=Pedros+Folding+Repair+Stand) 


In addition to these core tools, it's also helpful to have some miscellaneous home tools like a screwdriver set, pliers, high-grit sandpaper, and an adjustable wrench for various bike repair and maintenance tasks. Finally, don't forget to repurpose old cotton garments and toothbrushes as rags and cleaning accessories.

### My Pick
- [Screwdriver Set](https://amzn.to/3LA6bsg)
- [Needle Nose Plier](https://amzn.to/3PyGnhv)
- [Lineman Plier](https://amzn.to/3PPHuJR)
- [Adjustable Wrench](https://amzn.to/3EQlitL)
