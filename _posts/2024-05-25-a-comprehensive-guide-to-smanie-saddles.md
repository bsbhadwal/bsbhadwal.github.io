Finding the right bicycle saddle can indeed be a challenging task due to the plethora of options available, each catering to different preferences and needs. However, by focusing on the scientific aspects rather than solely relying on personal preferences, you can simplify the selection process.

In this article, we'll delve into the Smanie saddles available in India, categorising them based on various criteria such as design, features, and intended use. By doing so, we aim to provide clarity on which model might suit different types of riders best.

It's crucial to remember that despite our efforts to streamline the selection process, choosing a saddle ultimately remains a highly personal decision. Factors such as anatomy, riding style, and the terrain you frequent all play significant roles in determining the ideal saddle for you. Therefore, consider this article as a helpful starting point rather than a definitive answer, and be prepared to experiment to find the perfect saddle that enhances your cycling experience.

## Why Smanie?

Smanie (pronounced Sman-yeh) saddles stand out in the competitive saddle market with their unique blend of scientific precision and rider-centric design. Whether you're tackling rugged mountain trails or enduring long road rides, Smanie offers a diverse range of saddles tailored to suit various riding styles and terrains. What sets Smanie apart is their unwavering commitment to ergonomic comfort and performance, ensuring that each saddle is meticulously crafted to accommodate the individual anatomies and preferences of cyclists.

Additionally, I've found Smanie saddles to be competitively priced in the Indian market, making them an appealing option for riders seeking quality without breaking the bank. Whether you're aiming for podium finishes or embarking on epic cycling adventures, Smanie's dedication to innovation guarantees that you'll discover a saddle that not only fits your body perfectly but also enhances your overall cycling experience to new levels of enjoyment and performance.

## Smanie India 2024 range

Smanie introduces its sport range in India, emphasising value for money without compromising on essential features. These saddles prioritise affordability over lightweight attributes, opting for Chromoly steel rails known for their durability, albeit slightly heavier compared to other materials. In the 2024 lineup, Smanie offers four models tailored to modern cycling needs, each featuring a contemporary V shape and a strategically placed cutout for enhanced comfort and protection against groin numbness. These are:

1. **Smanie EX Explorer Sport**
2. **Smanie Delta Sport**
3. **Smanie Apex Sport**
4. **Smanie DRS Sport**

This combination of practical design and affordability makes Smanie's sport range an appealing choice for cyclists seeking reliable performance without breaking the bank. Let's explore each model in detail. 

But before we do that, I recommend spending the next 5 minutes watching this video because it provides a comprehensive overview of saddle anatomy and lists the various criteria that we will use to evaluate these saddles.

### The Comfort King: Smanie EX Explorer Sport Saddle

The Smanie EX Explorer Sport lives up to its name, offering the ultimate in comfort for adventure cyclists. Its generous 267mm length and 155mm width provide ample support for long days in the saddle, while 18mm of plush EVA padding strategically placed at the sit bones and nose ensures a luxurious feel. This extensive padding and elongated design make the EX Explorer ideal for endurance rides and varied terrain, perfectly aligning with Smanie's marketing pitch as an adventure saddle.

**Built to Explore, Affordably Priced**

Despite its impressive features, the EX Explorer boasts a remarkably low price tag, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious cyclists. The simple yet functional construction utilises a durable polyurethane (PU) cover, a lightweight polypropylene (PP) base, and reliable Chromoly rails. This combination ensures the saddle is weatherproof and hardwearing, a perfect companion for exploring new horizons without breaking the bank.

**Flat Curvature for Relaxed Riding**

The EX Explorer's flat curvature and generous length make it exceptionally compatible with upright riding positions, ideal for flat-bar bikes and endurance road bikes. This curvature also allows for easy manoeuvring, a benefit for riders who frequently shift positions, especially on technical terrain.

**Comfort on Any Path**

With ample padding, the EX Explorer effortlessly cushions against rough terrain, making it perfect for conquering the Himalayas or navigating India's bustling city streets. While the cutout is more conservative compared to other saddles, it effectively combats numbness for a comfortable ride on extended journeys.

**Considerations:**

The EX Explorer is slightly heavier than some other options and the thicker padding may raise your overall riding height. Additionally, the PU cover may appear less premium compared to other Smanie saddles.

**Who Should Ride This Saddle?**

- Hybrid bikes
- City commuters
- Long-distance mountain bikers
- Endurance road cyclists with a high stack height
- Bicycle tourers


### The Smanie Delta Sport: Your XC Weapon of Choice

For XC riders who push their limits on technical terrain, the Smanie Delta Sport saddle delivers exceptional comfort and support in an aggressive riding position. Its shorter, lighter profile is ideal for riders who favour a low and forward posture. While not as extreme as a pure race saddle, the Delta Sport offers ample support for intense training rides thanks to its rolled edges and 16mm of medium-density PU padding.

**Designed for Performance**

Smanie designed the Delta Sport for aggressive riders who prioritise performance over extreme comfort. The flat profile allows for freedom of movement while maintaining stability on rough terrain. The strategically placed cutout effectively combats numbness without sacrificing power transfer.

I've used the Delta Sport exclusively on my weekend XC rides with friends, typically lasting for 2-3 hours on our usual marked course with my United Clovis 6.10. It's also become my go-to saddle for 30-50km gravel interval training sessions. My brother, a lighter rider at 68kg, also prefers the Delta Sport over the Explorer EX for its *"less bulky feel and perfect balance of cushioning."*

**Considerations:**

The Delta Sport's shorter length offers less fore-aft movement compared to longer saddles. Additionally, the thicker padding may raise your overall riding height slightly.

| Saddle Attribute        | Value                        |

| Front to back curvature | Flat                         |

| Padding                 | Medium                       |


**Who Should Ride This Saddle?**

- Serious XC riders and racers
- Performance-oriented gravel riders
- Road cyclists who prefer a low, aggressive position on flat-bar bikes

### The Smanie Apex: Freedom and Comfort for Every Ride

For riders who crave freedom of movement and a comfortable ride on varied terrain, the Smanie Apex saddle delivers a perfect blend of support and performance. Its short, wide shape and gentle curvature provide a stable platform for moderate to hard efforts, making it ideal for everything from tarmac commutes to weekend gravel adventures. I've ridden the Apex for over six hours on a variety of routes, including tarmac and gravel, for rides ranging from 30 to 150 kilometres.

**Designed for Rider Comfort**

The Apex features a unique combination of gel and PU foam padding that's thinner than other Smanie saddles. This reduces pressure points and allows for a more natural riding position, avoiding the feeling of being "perched" on the saddle. Despite its minimal appearance, the padding offers surprising support for long rides, lasting me comfortably through 4-6 hour adventures. Additionally, the flatter profile and longer nose provide freedom of movement, ideal for riders who like to shift positions.

**Considerations:**

Compared to other Smanie saddles, the Apex features thinner gel and PU foam padding. While this design reduces pressure points and promotes a more natural riding position, it may not provide sufficient cushioning for riders who prefer a plush feel, especially on longer rides.

**Saddle Attributes**

**Who Should Ride This Saddle?**

- Road cyclists who value comfort and freedom of movement
- Gravel riders seeking a versatile saddle for various terrains
- Daily riders who spend moderate time in the saddle

### The Smanie DRS: Engineered for Aerodynamic Aggression

The Smanie DRS stands out as the most aggressive saddle in their lineup, featuring innovative rolled edges and a protective padding wing, all designed for maximum performance and comfort in a slammed, low-rider position. This saddle is ideal for road racers, time trial specialists, and aggressive climbers who prioritise aerodynamics and power transfer.

**Unmatched Support for Low Riders**

The DRS boasts an aggressive front-to-back slope, allowing for maximal pelvic rotation, perfect for riders who maintain a low, tucked position. The wider saddle wings combined with the rolled edges offer crucial support for full leg extension through the pedal stroke, minimising hamstring contact and maximising power transfer. This design eliminates the risk of chafing often associated with wider saddles when riders maintain an aggressive posture.

**Sleek Design, Superior Durability**

Epitomising the evolution of the modern racing saddle, the DRS boasts sleek lines and a compact profile (247mm x 145mm). Its minimalist design ensures a clear area for sit-bone placement, simplifying the adoption of a powerful riding posture. Furthermore, the unique padding protection wing on the back shields the saddle from wear and tear, ensuring long-lasting performance.

**Considerations:**

Smanie DRS is a good option for riders who prioritise aerodynamics and power transfer over plush comfort. If you tend to ride in a more upright position or for longer distances, you might want to consider a different saddle with more padding and a wider seating area.
