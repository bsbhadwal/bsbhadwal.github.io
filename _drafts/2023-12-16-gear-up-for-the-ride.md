My EX saddle has been a true companion for all terrains. Boasting 18mm of plush padding strategically placed on the sit-bone region and nose, it provides the extra comfort you need for long rides. Ready to tame the gravel roads, cobbles, or city potholes – the EX saddle is up for the challenge. Smanie claims the EX has been tested on legendary routes like the Oregon Outback and Allegheny Mountains Loop and I can see why. The EX features a cut-out design to prevent numbness during epic, multi-day bikepacking adventures.

Cash is king, and the EX saddle respects that. At ₹ 1,800 it is affordable without sacrificing quality. It keeps your money in your pocket and you on the road or trail.

## 2. Guee Safety Mirror
Pedaling into the rhythm of the open road is a liberating experience, but let's face it, we can't grow eyes in the back of our heads. That's where the humble rearview mirror swoops in as the unsung hero of cycling. 
Picture this: cruising down the highway, effortlessly glancing into your compact rearview mirror, and voila! You're in the know about the traffic tango happening behind you.

My pick - the Guee Safety Mirror. Why? Because the Guee Safety Mirror is engineered for user-friendly installation, requiring minimal effort and no specialized tools. Plus its universal design is suitable for left or right side mount and it features 360° horizontal and +/-20° adjustability. 

Constructed with durability in mind, the Guee Safety Mirror is designed to withstand the rigors of regular cycling. Its Shatter-proof PMMA mirror is shatter-proof and hence safer compared to glass. Finally it comes in superlight at just 30g. At just Rs. 660 the Guee Safety Mirror adds a dimension of safety for city and highway cyclists and this makes it a perfect yet thoughhtful cycling gift.
