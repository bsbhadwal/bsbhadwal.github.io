A mule path that leads to a 3744m mountain pass in the Pir Panjal mountain range. I had scouted this route on a hike last summer and it was the right candidate to try on a hardtail.



## Route breakdown
- 110 kms of metalled road leading to a major town.
- 60 kilometer dirt road from the town.
- 36 kilometres mule path / walking trail to the mountain pass. 
- 80 km stone covered jeepable dirt road.
- 60 kilometers rutted dirt road till it meets up with metalled road.
- 110 kilometers of metalled road.

## Bicycle choice
Since this is a mule path the gravel bike was out. There are numerous and sharp turns on this trail. Since this is a walking trail the gradients often exceed vehicular norms and there are a series of steps along the way. It is also post mid-October and I was expecting an overnight freeze. I chose my United Clovis 6.10 hardtail for this trip for the following reasons - 

1. 34-50T lowest gear for steep switchbacks and climbs.
2. Wide-r 2.1" tyresfor better grip because I was expecting an early morning freeze.
3. The suspension would help descend on rock stairs and through the jeep road which are covered with fist size rocks.
4. Wide bars for more control on climbs since this trail has no safety rail and drops can measure a few 100 metres.

## Gear
Given the technical climb, I took a minimalist gear approach. My gear was divided into the following 4 distinct storage spaces. [!Watch 1 min video on Reels]()

### Saddle Bag - Clothes
1. Decathlon Fleece pyjamas (doubles as emergency riding pants) - 1 pair
2. Vaude cycling shorts 1 pair

4. RAB Down Puffy Jacket - 1 pair
5. Vaseline, toothbrush and toilet paper

### NAC C2 mount - Spares
1. Topeak MTB frame pump
2. Spare TPU tube
3. TPU tube repair kit
4. Pedros ICM 21 multi tool
5. Elite fly water bottle 550ml in bottle cage

### Top Tube Bag - Snacks
1. Parle G biscuits - 2
2. 5 star chocolates - 5 
3. ORS sachets - 3

### Handlebar Bag - Camping
1. Bubble warp cut to my size 175 cm * 90 cm
2. Mountain Equipment Helium down sleeping bag rated to -10C
3. RAB alpine Bivy
4. Morakniv Garberg full tang knife with firestarter
5. Powerbank 20,000 mAH with USB C cable
6. Self-curated survival pack

### Hydration Bag - Daily / Ride essentials
1. Sunglasses with soft case
2. Chiba Gel riding gloves
3. Water bladder empty (for emergencies)

## What Went Well (WWW)

### United Clovis
I hit a home run with this choice. I've tried similar routes on a gravel bike only to realise that while it can cope with rutted jeep roads, it doesnt cope well with a mule track. This is not just about the lower gearing. It has more to do with the control that wide flat bars provide on sharp turns coupled with quick and steep incline and declines. Drop bars don't work well in this landscape.
The Clovis 6.10 turned out to be perfect for this kind of terrain. Nimble and well-balanced. The coil fork protected my hands and overall I had no issues even with the heavy unexpected snowfall at the mountain pass. 

### Coil suspension
One of the reasons to pick the Clovis 6.10 over the 7.10 is because a coil susopension is better suited to bikepacking in the cold than an air suspoension. Primarly because a coil suspension has less seals and hence less maintainnece and oil is not as easily affected by temperature and elevation unlike air pressure. The SR Suntour XCR 32 suspension worked very well on this terrain. It helped that I could lock it off on climbs and I had added an extra 2 clicks of preload adjustment.

### Hydration pack
I usually use the hydration pack as a quick access bag for my essentails, and Im glad I carried it for this trip. The route was blocked by snow for 2 days and I could use this as a backpack while off the bike. Plus it helped me stay hydrated on the long climbs. One often forgets to sip water in the cold, but a hydration bitevalve is a constabnt reminder to keep drinking.

### Panaracer Gravelikng SK+
While not rated for snow and ice, the GravelKing SK+ were just brilliant through snow and ice. It was not that they didnt slip, but the loss of grip was linear and predictable. Plus I had no punctures on the entire trip thanks to their "+" monikor which features extra puncture protection.

## Take A Look At (TALA)

### Pay more attention to weather forecast
I should have paid more attention to the two day rain that was forecast. I got cocky and thought it would just be a thunderstorm. It turned out to be two days of heavy rain which left the mountain pass with over a meter of snow. This meant I had to wait for a day on the shoulder of the mountain before the pass was safe to cross over.

### Carry a travel towel
I missed carrying my travel towl on this tour. Usually I wash my face at a stream and then wipe dry using a microfiber towel. On this trip since I didn't wipe down, I caught a cold. No towel meant I had to wash my face with water early morning. Washing your face with ice cold water at sub zero temperatures is no fun.
